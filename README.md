### Bootcamp Project: Bulletin Board Application

**Description:**  
As my first project in the bootcamp, I developed a bulletin board application using Spring Boot and JPA. This project involved creating a robust and scalable platform for posting and managing board entries.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend services and handling application logic.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For managing database interactions and entity relationships.

**Features:**
- Add User, and retrieving user information
- Post creation, editing, and retrieving

**Objective:**  
To gain hands-on experience with Spring Boot and JPA while building a functional and user-friendly bulletin board application.
